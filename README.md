# Variant Sale
Granular control over sale items, control variant visibility based on collection

## How it works
When viewing an item in a specified collection, only show variants matching certain conditions. This could be used for only showing variants with a "conpare at price" when products are viewed through the "on sale" or similarly themed collection. 
Note the difference when arriving at the product via the Clearance collection on this test store:

and when you to arrive to the product detail page directly, from other collections  etc.:
